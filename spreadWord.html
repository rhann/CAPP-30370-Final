			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community.
			<p>The Notre Dame Special Olympics Club is partnered with Special Olympics Indiana to brings students closer to the South Bend Community through service and events hosted by the club. Unified Soccer and Spread the Word to End the Word are the club's primary events each year.</p>
			<p>Unified Soccer is a tournament with teams composed of both Special Olympic athletes and students from Notre Dame. At the tournament, Notre Dame's Unified Team competes against teams from the University of Michigan and Central Michigan in friendly competition. This event allows students to build relationships with athletes form the South Bend and Michiana communities.</p>
			<p>Spread the Word to End the Word is a national campaign to end the use of the word 'retard(ed)'. The campaign asks people to pledge to stop saying the R-word as a starting point toward creating more accepting attitudes and communities for all people.  Language affects attitudes and attitudes affect actions.  </p>
