#Notre Dame Special Olympics

This website was designed to be the University of Notre Dame's Special Olympics Club Website. This site will offer information about the club and the events that the club hosts each year. This website highlights the clubs two major events each year, **Unified Soccer** and **Spread the Word to End the Word**. The website also includes a form, so visitors to the site can get involved with the club.

The purpose of this site is to inform the Notre Dame community about the ND Special Olympics Club and its events. Another goal of this site is to increase involvement in the NDSO club from athletes in the South Bend Community and with students at Notre Dame.
